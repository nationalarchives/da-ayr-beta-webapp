    <p class="govuk-body">
        The National Archives is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the
        Public Sector Bodies
        (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.
    </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-accessible content</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
            Breadcrumb navigation links have been placed inside of the main content region of the
            page. This issue may affect keyboard only and screen reader users who use the 'Skip to main
            content' link and would expect to bypass repeated blocks of content including the header
            and any navigational regions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some HTML heading markup has been used in a way that does not accurately represent relationships
            in the content, particularly on the static page content.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        It would be a disproportionate burden to fix records held on the Access Your Records platform as we are required to keep all records exactly as they have been delivered. This is to ensure that each record is completely authentic and faithfully matches what has been published by the original source.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="improve-accessibility">What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We are working to resolve accessibility issues as soon as possible. These issues include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
            moving the breadcrumb navigation links so they are outside the main content region to enable keyboard and screen reader users to skip to the main content
        </li>
        <li>fixing the HTML heading markup issues found on some static content pages</li>
