</ul>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
    Do not include any problems where you're claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).

<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
    In in this subsection list accessibility problems you're claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
    You must carry out an assessment before claiming disproportionate burden.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
    Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.

    Add examples. Your statement should be specific to your website.

<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
    Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-body--accessibility-placeholder">
